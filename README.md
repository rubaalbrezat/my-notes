# my-notes
I am **Ruba Al-Barizat**, I am 21 years old, I studied software engineering at Al-Hussein Bin Talal University, and as a new graduate, I need to develop my skills and experience, I joined this course at ***ltuc***.

This article explains the basics of the developer mindset well, which we summarize as follows:

1. Visualize the purpose of the program
2. Software design goals
3. misunderstanding
4. simplicity
5. complication
6. Maintenance work
7. consistency
8. prioritization
9. solving problems
10. good enough is fine
11. predictions
12. Assumptions
13. Stop reinventing
14. resistance
15. automation
16. productivity
17. Tests
18. (under) appreciation
19. Escape from rewriting
20. Documentation and comment
21. Picking techniques (tools, libraries, etc.)
22. Self development
23. Don't be a hero
24. Don't ask questions... ask for help


It also deals with giving programmers important tips to develop themselves, making them smart programmers skilled in their work, including:

Fans should not be listened to, understand the purpose of the program well, your design should be easy for you and useful for others, misunderstanding leads to complexity, which leads to more misunderstanding, a good developer creates things that are easy to understand so that it is really easy to get rid of all the bugs Simplicity is important to create correct code Maintainability is one of the most important things in software development Consistency is a big part of simplicity Prioritizing analysis is important to know the next step Don't strive for perfection Don't anticipate the future No need for unnecessary changes Code quality does not depend On the number of lines written, you shouldn't guess the source of the error and apply the fixes based on your assumption Breaking the big thing down into small things Rewriting the code from scratch is not the solution The real purpose of comments is to explain "why" you did something, not "what" you're doing Code, don't rely too much on outside aid, try new learning methods and different programming languages, and remember not to always be a hero.
